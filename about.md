# About Me

Hello! I'm **James E. Torres**, software engineer :wave:

I'm based out of Rhode Island. I'm nearing a decade in the field and specialize in and have a passion for solving problems collaboratively.

Backend development is my forte, but I also enjoy working on full-stack projects. Whatever the challenge, I'm eager to understand and tackle it head-on; from gathering requirements, designing solutions, coding, testing, and deploying are all part of the journey I embrace to deliver high-quality software :muscle: Check out my [resume](resume.md) for more specifics.

During my spare time, I enjoy reading :book:, video games, jogging and calisthethics :running:, pro-wrestling, historical documentaries, learning about the cosmos (astrophysics), and exploring new technologies in my spare time :thinking:

Feel free to reach out to me via the [contact page](contact.md) :smile:

Take care!
