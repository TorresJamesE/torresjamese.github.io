Hello! I'm **James E. Torres**, software engineer :wave:

I'm nearing a decade in the field and specialize in and have a passion for solving problems collaboratively. Backend development is my forte (APIs, DBs), but I also enjoy working on full-stack projects. Whatever the challenge, I'm eager to understand and tackle it head-on :muscle:

I enjoy reading :book:, video games, jogging and calisthethics :running:, and exploring new technologies :thinking:

Feel free to reach out to me through my [contact page](contact.md) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesetorres/) :smile:
