## IDK What to Eat

This is a small side project to assist myself and others by recommending a dish. Users can select preferences to narrow recommendations down to a particular cuisine or diet.

It is built using React + Typescript, using the Next.js framework. Originally, I was going to connect it to a backend API to fetch information via a Supabase setup. However, the data set was more than small enough not to warrant the extra complexity.
